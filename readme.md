# CSCI 5345 Team Project: ScholarSync

## Dependencies

* Rust (any new-ish version should work).
* An OpenAI API key (for generating descriptions).

## Running

1. Please ensure that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is either set as an environment variable or is defined in `scholarsync-backend/.env`.
2. Please run the backend via
   ```bash
   cd scholarsync-backend
   cargo run
   ```
3. You may now run the app. _The application will currently have to run on the same machine as the backend server._
